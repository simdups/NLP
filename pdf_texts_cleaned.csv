As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average all-in-one computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life 
cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average all-in-one computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

†All estimates of carbon 
footprint are uncertain. HP Inc  
reports the 5th and 95th 
percentile of the carbon 
footprint estimate to reflect 
that uncertainty. For this 
product, that estimate has a 
mean of 370 kg of CO2 -e and 
standard deviation of 110 kg of 
CO2 -e. Other organizations 
might report this value as 370 
+/- 110 kg of CO2 -e.” 
  
 
 
As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.   
The information provided here was calculated  using the PAIA tool†† and represents the lifecycle 
carbon footprint of a n industry -average all-in-one computer with  the specifications listed in

 The plot below shows the uncertainty associated with the various elements of the product carbon 
footprint.  Uncertainty in product carbon footprinting stems from differences in the data, assumptions, and methodology used.  Since uncertainty can be quite large, results should not be compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

accurate   data, HP  uses  HP-specific tools,  processes, and  product  data,  a well as high-quality lifecycleassessment data. To  increase  
transparency,   HP  reports   the   PCF   mean  and  uncertainty  range.  Since  uncertainty  will  never be   minimized   completely,   HP  does   
notrecommend  comparison  of PCF estimates from different manufacturers.

reports the 5th and 95th 
percentile of the carbon 
footprint estimate to reflect 
that unce rtainty. For this 
product, that estimate has a 
mean of 450 kg of CO2 -e and

As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.   
The information provided here was calculated  using the PAIA tool†† and represents the lifecycle 
carbon footprint of a n industry -average desktop  computer with  the specifications listed in Under

The plot below shows the uncertainty associated with the various elements of the product carbon 
footprint.  Uncertainty in product carbon footprinting stems from differences in the data, assumptions, and methodology used.  Since uncertainty can be quite large, results should not be compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average desktop computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.

 The plot below shows the uncertainty associated with the various elements of the product carbon 
footprint.  Uncertainty in product carbon footprinting stems from differences in the data, 
assumptions, and methodology used.  Since uncertainty can be quite la rge, results should not be 
compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life 
cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of 
greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be 
completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain 
emissions, which incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average notebook computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but 
uncertainty will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

Product  carbon footprint results are highly dependent on the tools, carbon  emissions data, and assumptions used. To provide themost 
accurate   data, HP  uses  HP-specific tools,  processes, and  product  data,  a well as high-quality lifecycleassessment data. To  increase  
transparency,   HP  reports   the   PCF   mean  and  uncertainty  range.  Since  uncertainty  will  never be   minimized   completely,   HP  does

The site also contains IT Eco Declarations, which provide product-
specific environmental information, as well as information on HP’s 
product recycling programs.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

†All estimates of carbon 
footprint are uncertain. HP Inc  
reports the 5th and 95th 
percentile of the carbon 
footprint estimate to reflect 
that uncertainty. For this 
product, that estimate has a 
mean of 555 kg of CO2 -e and 
standard deviation of 120 kg of 
CO2 -e. Other organizations 
might report this value as 555 
+/- 120 kg of CO2 -e.   
 
 
As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.   
The information provided here was calculated  using the PAIA tool†† and represents the lifecycle 
carbon footprint of a n industry -average display  with  the specifications listed in Under 
Assumptions on Page 2.    
 GHG emissions [percentage of total]  
 
 
  
 
The plot below shows the uncertainty associated with the various elements of the product carbon 
footprint.  Uncertainty in product carbon footprinting stems from differences in the data, 
assumptions, and methodology used.  Since uncertainty can be quite large, results should not b e 
compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life 
cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average notebook computer  with the specifications listed in 
Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of 
greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be 
completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.

The plot below shows the uncertainty associated with the various elements of the product carbon 
footprint.  Uncertainty in product carbon footprinting stems from differences in the data, assumptions, and methodology used.  Since uncertainty can be quite large, results should not be compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

reports the 5th and 95th 
percentile of the carbon 
footprint estimate to reflect 
that uncertainty. For this 
product, that estimate has a 
mean of 460  kg of CO2 -e and

As part of HP’s com mitment to continually improve  the environmental performance of our 
products, we are focusing on better understanding the impacts that occur at different stages of 
the product life cycle through the use of product carbon footprinting (PCF).  A product carbon 
footprint is defined as the  total amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a 
product over its lifetime.  It includes emissions from materials extraction, manufacturing, 
distribution, use, and end -of-life management.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of 
greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never 
be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

1. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse  gases  emitted  directly  and  indirectly  by  a product  over  its  lifetime.  Greenhouse  gas 
emissions are reported as global warming potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Calculationsare  done in  accordance  with  ISO  
14040 &  ISO 14044. 
2. The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of the most common configuration for this product.Specifications used in this assessment 
are  listed  in the  assumptions  table. HP  reports the estimated mean PCF value along  with  confidence  intervals.  Individual  values  may  not  sum  to  total  due  to  
rounding.

(PCF[1]). This helps HP  to understand carbon  impacts and implement  reduction  opportunities throughout a product's life  cycle.  HP's  
PCFs  cover full value  chain  emissions,  which  include  carbon  emissions  due to   raw  materials  extraction,  component  and  product  
manufacturing, distribution,  product  use,  and  end-of-service.  To  learn   more    about HP's  climate  efforts,   see   below   and   visit   
hp.com/sustainability. 
Product  carbon footprint results are highly dependent on the tools, carbon  emissions data, and assumptions used. To provide themost 
accurate   data, HP  uses  HP-specific tools,  processes, and  product  data,  a well as high-quality lifecycleassessment data. To  increase  
transparency,   HP  reports   the   PCF   mean  and  uncertainty  range.  Since  uncertainty  will  never be   minimized   completely,   HP  does   
notrecommend  comparison  of PCF estimates from different manufacturers.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain 
emissions, which incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but 
uncertainty will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

 The plot below shows the uncertainty associated with the various elements of the product carbon 
footprint.  Uncertainty in product carbon footprinting stems from differences in the data, 
assumptions, and methodology used.  Since uncertainty can be quite large, results should not be 
compared with those of other products, but rather are intended to inform product design and life 
cycle management decisions.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of 
greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from 
data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product 
data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be 
completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to better 
understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse 
gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which incorporates carbon 
emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely from data 
limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and product data, as well as 
high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty will never be completely minimized 
and results should be considered accordingly.

potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

1. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total amount of greenhouse  gases  emitted  directly  and  indirectly  by  a product  over  its  lifetime.  Greenhouse  gas 
emissions are reported as global warming potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Calculationsare  done in  accordance  with  ISO  
14040 &  ISO 14044. 
2. The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of the most common configuration for this product.Specifications used in this assessment 
are  listed  in the  assumptions  table. HP  reports the estimated mean PCF value along  with  confidence  intervals.  Individual  values  may  not  sum  to  total  due  to  
rounding. 
3. Others includes assembly energy, other subassemblies, and all subassemblies packaging and transport.

additional  warranty. HP shall not be liable for technical or editorial errors or omissions contained herein.As   part  of  HP’s  commitment  to  continually  improve  product  sustainability,  one  tool   HP utilizes is product carbonfootprinting  (PCF[1]). 
This helps HP  to understand carbon  impacts and implement  reduction  opportunities throughout a product's life  cycle.  HP's  PCFs  cover 
full value  chain  emissions,  which  include  carbon  emissions  due to   raw  materials  extraction,  component  and  product  manufacturing, 
distribution,  product  use,  and  end-of-service.  To  learn   more    about HP's  climate  efforts,   see   below   and   visit   hp.com/sustainability. 
Product  carbon footprint results are highly dependent on the tools, carbon  emissions data, and assumptions used. To provide themost 
accurate   data, HP  uses  HP-specific tools,  processes, and  product  data,  a well as high-quality lifecycleassessment data. To  increase  
transparency,   HP  reports   the   PCF   mean  and  uncertainty  range.  Since  uncertainty  will  never be   minimized   completely,   HP  does   
notrecommend  comparison  of PCF estimates from different manufacturers.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle.  A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as global warming 
potential for 100-year time horizon (GWP-100) in units of CO2 equivalence. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain emissions, which 
incorporate carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
HP's environmental impact calculations are done in accordance with ISO 14040/44. All estimates of impact results are uncertain, resulting largely 
from data limitations and data quality. To mitigate this uncertainty, HP has developed HP-specific tools that use a combination of HP processes and 
product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

product data, as well as high-quality lifecycle assessment data. HP strives to provide the most accurate environmental impact results but uncertainty 
will never be completely minimized and results should be considered accordingly.

As part of HP’s commitment to continually improve the environmental performance of our products, we utilize product carbon footprinting (PCF) to 
better understand environmental impacts that occur at different stages of the product life cycle. A product carbon footprint is defined as the total 
amount of greenhouse gases emitted directly and indirectly by a product over its lifetime. Our product carbon footprints include full value chain 
emissions, which incorporates carbon emissions due to raw materials extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and product end-of-use.
The information provided here represents the lifecycle carbon footprint of an industry-average display  with the specifications listed in Assumptions 
table.
